## こんにちは、ようこそ! 👋🏻

### About me ❓
I'm a 17 years old student interested in Softare Engineering, I am currently studying my last semester in High School so I aim to be the best at the University and stand out with great work. 

About me, I can tell you that I like to use GNU/Linux distributions like [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) as investigate about Unix's History, play video games like Terraria or League of Legends, read a book and watch Anime. (I'm a nerd).
